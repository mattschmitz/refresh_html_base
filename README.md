# refresh_html_base

I use this repo to test out vanilla HTML/CSS. Run `npx nodemon server.js` and navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser. Anytime you save a file in the repo the page will auto-refresh. I find this faster than online sandboxes and other methods (like [livejs script tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5588658/auto-reload-browser-when-i-save-changes-to-html-file-in-chrome)).

You could add React to this, but I'd recommend instead just using [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
