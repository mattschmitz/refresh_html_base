# refresh_html_base

_TL;DR_ run `npx nodemon server.js` and navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.

This is a repo that sets up a node server and auto refreshes an html page. It's a good place to start vanilla html/css dev and testing (like create-react-app but not react specific and lighter weight)

Anytime you save a file, the browser page will automatically refresh. (This is faster than putting a `<script type="text/javascript" src="https://livejs.com/live.js"></script>` tag in the html as recommended by https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5588658/auto-reload-browser-when-i-save-changes-to-html-file-in-chrome)
